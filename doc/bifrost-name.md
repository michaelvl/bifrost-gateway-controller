# About the Bifrost Name

The name [*Bifrost*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st) comes
from [Scandinavian
mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology) and is the
name of the bridge between the homes of the humans and the gods,
i.e. earth and heaven.

The *bifrost-gateway-controller* bridges the Kubernetes world and the
Cloud world, and with Denmark being part of Scandinavia, we found the
name fitting.

Bifrost is supposed to be destroyed in
[Ragnarok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k). Such an event
is, however, not planned for the present gateway controller.
