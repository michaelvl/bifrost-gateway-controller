# Creating GatewayClass Definitions

This document describes how to create new `GatewayClass`
definitions. See also [Example GatewayClass
Definitions](example-gatewayclasses.md) for the definitions provided
with the *cloud-gateway-controller*.

Before preparing new `GatewayClass` definitions, it is important to
understand the normalization implemented by the controller, since
`GatewayClass` definitions typically will use the normalized
specifications to define actual data path resources. See
[Normalization of Gateway Resources](normalization.md).

TBD.
